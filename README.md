- 👋 Hi, I’m @hiwayman-cyber
- 👀 I’m interested in electromagnetic physics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning alternative applications for the extended properties of this science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with those working to further our knowledge in the little understood peripheral functions & effects of electromagnetism.
- 📫 How to reach me is easiest done through my GitHub repository hiwayman-cyber/Gravity-controller.
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a beginner in the study of physics, but have compensated my relative lack of experience with great enthusiasm to catch up.
